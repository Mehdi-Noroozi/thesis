\section{Corpus}
Our message corpus was drawn from Slack chat logs of a major Norwegian software company team. The company has two development centers, one in Norway and one in Poland. Chat logs, consisting of around 30000 messages were gathered from Oct. 20, 2014 to Aug. 25, 2017. This does not include the private messages and just the public and private group messages were exported due to limitations that Slack imposes to some of its subscriptions.
